## Experiment
The experiment was made of {{ formated.num_actions }} actions, to vary conditions in your system, and {{ formated.num_probes }} probes, to collect objective data from your system during the experiment.

### Steady State Hypothesis
The steady state hypothesis this experiment tried was **"{{ experiment['steady-state-hypothesis'].title }}"**.

It was verified with the following probes:
| Probe | Tolerance |
| --- | --- |
{% for probe in experiment['steady-state-hypothesis'].probes -%}
| {{ probe.name }} | `{{ probe.tolerance }}` |
{% endfor %}

### Method
The experiment method defines the sequence of activities that help gathering evidence towards, or against, the hypothesis.

The following activities were conducted as part of the experimental's method:
| Type | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
{% for step in experiment['method'] -%}
| {{ step.type | capitalize }} | {{ step.name }} |
{% endfor %}

### Rollbacks
The experiment rollbacks defines the sequence of activities that is executed at the end of an experiment regarless if the experiment was successful or not.

The following activities were conducted as part of the experimental's rollback:
| Type | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
{% for step in experiment['rollbacks'] -%}
| {{ step.type | capitalize }} | {{ step.name }} |
{% endfor %}

## Result
The experiment was conducted on {{ formated.start }} and lasted for {{ formated.duration.seconds }} seconds.

### Steady States
{% for stage in ['before', 'after'] %}
#### {{ stage | capitalize }}
The steady state was {% if steady_states[stage].steady_state_met -%}
 **MET**
{%- else -%}
 **NOT MET**
{%- endif %} before the experiment was executed.

{% for step in steady_states[stage].probes %}
**{{ step.activity.type | capitalize }} - {{ step.activity.name }}**
| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Tolerance | ```{{ step.activity.tolerance }}``` |
| Output | ```{{ step.output }}``` |
| Tolerance met | ```{{ step.tolerance_met }}``` |
| Status | {{ step.status | capitalize }} |
| Background | N/A |
| Started | {{ step.start }} |
| Ended | {{ step.end }} |
| Duration | {{ step.duration }} seconds |

The {{ step.activity.type }} provider that was executed:

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
{% for key, value in step.activity.provider.items() -%}
| `{{ key }}` | ```{{ value }}``` |
{% endfor -%}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

#### After
The steady state was {% if steady_states.after.steady_state_met -%}
 **MET**
{%- else -%}
 **NOT MET**
{%- endif %} after the experiment was executed.

**{{ step.activity.type | capitalize }} - {{ step.activity.name }}**
| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | {{ step.status | capitalize }} |
| Background | N/A |
